   "TOP_LEVEL" is an NCD, version 3.2, device xc4vlx25, package ff668, speed -10
This design is using the default stepping level (major silicon revision) for
this device (1). Unless your design is targeted at devices of this stepping
level, it is recommended that you explicitly specify the stepping level of the
parts you will be using. This will allow the tools to take advantage of any
available performance and functional enhancements for this device. The latest
stepping level for this device is '2'. Additional information on "stepping
level" is available at support.xilinx.com.

INFO:Bitgen:40 - Replacing "Auto" with "NoWait" for option "Match_cycle".  Most
   commonly, bitgen has determined and will use a specific value instead of the
   generic command-line value of "Auto".  Alternately, this message appears if
   the same option is specified multiple times on the command-line.  In this
   case, the option listed last will be used.
